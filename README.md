# Welcome to Virtual Study Rooms! 🎉

Hey there! Thanks for checking out our project! What we have here is a **virtual study room!** 

# Functions ⚒️

 - Multiple people can join!
 - Live chat with with other students to collaborate
 - Students can share their **notes, homework**!
 - Students can make their own **to-do lists**
 - Fun timers and alarms! 

# What we used ⚙️

We used the following functionalities to develop our project-

 - Svelte
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - Bulma CSS
 - Google Firebase

# How it works ⚙️

 - On the Homepage we can see an input where the user can input the room no. if there is any or else they can create one and ask their friends to join it or they can just generate one
 - The Room code should be of 8 digits only so that we can have a lot of combinations
 - If the user inputs a room id which doesn't exists than it redirects them to the invalid page where they can either choose to re-enter the RoomID or create one
 - Once the user is in the Room, there they can use the **chat** feature to interact, a **Todo** list to make a note of their daily tasks and a **music player** to help the user concentrate.
